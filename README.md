# Onpremnetes The Hard Way On VirtualBox

This tutorial walks you through setting up Kubernetes the hard way on a local machine using VirtualBox.
This guide is not for people looking for a fully automated command to bring up a Kubernetes cluster.
If that's you then check out [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), or the [Getting Started Guides](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/).

Kubernetes The Hard Way is optimized for learning, which means taking the long route to ensure you understand each task required to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster.

This tutorial is a modified version of the original developed by [Kelsey Hightower](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way).
While the original one uses GCP as the platform to deploy kubernetes,  we use VirtualBox and Vagrant to deploy a cluster on a local machine. If you prefer the cloud version, refer to the original one [here](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)

Another difference is that we use Docker instead of containerd. There are a few other differences to the original and they are documented [here](docs/differences-to-original.md)

> The results of this tutorial should not be viewed as production ready, and may receive limited support from the community, but don't let that stop you from learning!

## Target Audience

The target audience for this tutorial is someone planning to support a production Kubernetes cluster and wants to understand how everything fits together.

## Cluster Details

Kubernetes The Hard Way guides you through bootstrapping a highly available Kubernetes cluster with end-to-end encryption between components and RBAC authentication.
